TASK1:-. Advanced Caching Options
If you need a more robust solution or plan to scale up, consider these options:

Cache Libraries:
Use a caching library like cachetools which provides a TTL (Time-To-Live) cache.
Example with cachetools:

CODE_PART:
from cachetools import TTLCache
cache = TTLCache(maxsize=1, ttl=3600)  # Cache size 1, TTL 1 hour


def get_spotify_token():
    if 'token' in cache:
        return cache['token']
    # Else, request token, then:
    token = ...  # same token request code
    cache['token'] = token
    return token


Distributed Cache:
For a production application, consider using a distributed caching solution like Redis, especially if your backend is running on multiple servers.

Background Scheduler:
If you expect high traffic, you could set up a background scheduler (e.g., with APScheduler(read from coderslegacy youtube channel)) to refresh the token periodically rather than on demand.


Summary(THERE ARE THREE WAY FOR TOKEN SYSTEM TO HANDLE)
In-Memory Caching:
Use global variables to store the token and its expiry time, checking the validity before making new requests.
Expiration Check:
Compare the current time with the expiry time and refresh the token if needed.
Advanced Options:
Consider cache libraries, distributed caches, or background schedulers for a production-level solution.


TASK2:-ðŸ”¹ Where to Use Socket.IO in Your Emotion-Based Music Recommendation System?
To make your project more advanced and interactive, you can use Socket.IO in the following ways:

Live Emotion Detection Updates

When the user starts their webcam, the system should continuously send emotion data from the client to the server.
Instead of making multiple HTTP requests, use Socket.IO to stream the emotion data to the backend in real-time.
The server can process the emotion and instantly recommend music.
Real-Time Music Recommendations

As soon as the userâ€™s emotion changes, the system should instantly update the music suggestions.
Instead of refreshing the page or making multiple requests, the server can push the updated recommendations to the client.
User Engagement Features (Optional for Advanced Level)

Live chat with AI assistant to discuss moods and song suggestions.
Mood history tracking (real-time chart showing emotions over time).
Multi-user synchronization (if multiple users share emotions, create a shared playlist).




TASK3:-ðŸ”¹ Other Things to Improve Your Project for Big Companies
To make your project industry-level, you should also consider:

âœ… Microservices Architecture â†’ Separate emotion detection, music recommendation, and user management into different services for scalability.
âœ… Machine Learning for Emotion Detection â†’ Instead of fixed labels, use Deep Learning (CNNs or LSTMs) to detect emotions more accurately.
âœ… Database Integration â†’ Use MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or Firebase to store user preferences and track past emotions.
âœ… Cloud Deployment â†’ Host your backend on AWS, Google Cloud, or DigitalOcean to make it production-ready.
âœ… Authentication System â†’ Add user login/signup with JWT authentication to provide personalized music recommendations.
âœ… Real-Time Features â†’ Use WebSockets (Socket.IO) for live updates, group listening sessions, and AI chatbots.
âœ… Mobile App Integration â†’ Build a React Native app so users can detect emotions and get recommendations on their phones.



TASK4:Enhanced Music Recommendations:
Integrate with real APIs (like Spotify or Last.fm) to fetch dynamic music recommendations based on user mood or history.
User Interaction Features:
Add features such as favorites, playlists, or user ratings to enhance engagement.
Search and Filter:
Expand the filtering capabilities in CategoryFilter to allow for more complex queries or multiple criteria.


TASK5:Accessibility & Performance:

Accessibility:
Audit your project for accessibility improvements (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, color contrast, etc.).
Performance Optimization:
Use techniques such as lazy loading, code splitting, and optimizing image assets to ensure fast load times.
